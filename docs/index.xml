&lt;p>QueryCanary is a lightweight, SQL-powered monitoring tool that helps you catch silent data failures in production databases — before they impact customers or downstream systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was built to proactively alert you to real problems, either from issues you may suspect exist or most importantly things that have bitten you before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, it can be used to keep track of values over time and even provide simple dashboards for your data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SSH Tunnel</title><link>/docs/ssh-tunnel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/ssh-tunnel/</guid><description>&lt;p>SSH tunnels provide a secure way to connect to your database by routing traffic through an intermediary SSH server. This ensures that sensitive data is encrypted and protected during transit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an easy way to connect QueryCanary to your production database servers, without exposing them to the public web.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-ssh-tunnel">What is a SSH Tunnel?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>An SSH tunnel creates a secure connection between QueryCanary.com&amp;rsquo;s runner machines and your remote server. It forwards a local port to a target database port on the remote server, allowing you to securely access the database as if it were running locally.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
